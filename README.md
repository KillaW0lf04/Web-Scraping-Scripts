Scripts
=======

A Random set of Python Scripts that can be used on various machines through
a command line interface. They provide the user with the ability to download
key items from various websites using web scraping techniques.

They can be run on any Windows, Linux or Mac machine with a Python interpreter

The following scripts can be found in the src folder:
* Cyanide and Happiness Comic Downloader
* XKCD Comic Downloader
* NASA Picture of the Day Image Downloader

NOTE: It has been suggested by various members of the reddit community that i could have also implemented
these scripts usingthe beautiful soup library (http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/). Thanks!
